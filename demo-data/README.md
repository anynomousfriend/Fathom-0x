## 🎤 What to Say When Demonstrating

### **When Selecting File:**
> "I'm going to upload a confidential [medical record / financial report / research paper]. This demonstrates the [healthcare / enterprise / research] use case."

### **During Encryption:**
> "Watch - the document is being encrypted client-side with AES-256. The plaintext never leaves my browser. This is bank-level encryption happening right here before my eyes."

### **After Upload:**
> "Walrus now has this encrypted blob stored across decentralized nodes. Without my decryption key, it's just gibberish. No single server can read this data."

### **When Asking Question:**
> "Now I can ask questions about this confidential document without exposing the raw data. The AI can answer because it processes in a secure environment, but the document itself stays encrypted on Walrus."

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **Choose the Right Document:**
- **Healthcare Investors?** → Use patient_record.txt
- **Enterprise Focus?** → Use financial_report.txt
- **Technical Judges?** → Use research_paper.txt

### **Make It Personal:**
> "Imagine you're a hospital with thousands of patient records..."
> "Think about your company's financial data..."
> "Consider a researcher with patent-pending discoveries..."

### **Emphasize the Problem:**
Before demo: "Currently, hospitals CAN'T use AI on patient records because..."
