NON-STANDARD PROVISIONS

   - This represents 15% of deal value

   - Year 2: $20M if revenue > $150M  
   - Year 3: $20M if revenue > $200M
   
   Note: Targets appear aggressive given historical growth rates

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. NEGOTIATE NON-COMPETE
   - Reduce scope to 3 years or narrow geographic/industry restrictions
   - Add carve-outs for key personnel career mobility

2. CLARIFY MAC CLAUSE
   - Add specific materiality thresholds (e.g., >15% revenue decline)
   - Define force majeure events explicitly

3. REVIEW IP OWNERSHIP
   - Conduct comprehensive IP audit before closing
   - Clear documentation of jointly developed IP

4. STRUCTURE TAX EFFICIENCY
   - Consider Section 368 reorganization treatment
   - Evaluate state tax implications

5. ENHANCE EMPLOYEE RETENTION
   - Increase retention bonuses for critical engineering talent
   - Accelerate vesting for top performers

CONCLUSION

The merger agreement is generally well-drafted but contains several non-standard 
provisions that warrant negotiation. The high reverse breakup fee and aggressive 
non-compete terms suggest power imbalance favoring the acquirer.

Primary recommendation: Negotiate modifications to non-compete, MAC clause, and 
earnout structure before finalizing the agreement.

Overall deal assessment: PROCEED WITH MODIFICATIONS
