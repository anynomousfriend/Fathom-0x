- Hyperlipidemia
- Family history: Father died of heart disease at age 62

CURRENT MEDICATIONS
1. Metformin 1000mg twice daily (diabetes)
2. Lisinopril 20mg once daily (blood pressure)
3. Atorvastatin 40mg once daily (cholesterol)
4. Aspirin 81mg once daily (antiplatelet)
5. Metoprolol 50mg twice daily (beta blocker)

ALLERGIES
⚠️ SEVERE ALLERGIES:
- Penicillin (anaphylaxis - documented 2010)
- Sulfa drugs (severe rash)
- Latex (contact dermatitis)

VITAL SIGNS (Current Visit)
- Blood Pressure: 152/94 mmHg (elevated)
- Heart Rate: 88 bpm
- Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths/min
- Temperature: 98.6°F
- O2 Saturation: 96% on room air
- Weight: 195 lbs (BMI: 29.4 - overweight)

LABORATORY RESULTS (Nov 15, 2024)
- Troponin I: 0.08 ng/mL (slightly elevated, normal <0.04)
- BNP: 245 pg/mL (elevated, suggests heart strain)
- HbA1c: 7.8% (diabetes not well controlled)
- LDL Cholesterol: 142 mg/dL (above target)
- Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL (mild kidney impairment)

DIAGNOSTIC TESTS

ECG (Electrocardiogram):
- Sinus rhythm
- ST segment depression in leads V4-V6
- Suggests myocardial ischemia
- Compared to baseline ECG from 2023: new changes present

Echocardiogram:
- Left ventricular ejection fraction: 48% (mildly reduced, normal >55%)
- Mild left ventricular hypertrophy
- No valvular abnormalities
- Mild mitral regurgitation

Stress Test (Scheduled):
- Patient unable to complete due to chest pain at 5 minutes
- Test terminated early
- Suggests significant coronary artery disease

Cardiac Catheterization (Recommended):
- High suspicion for coronary blockages
- Scheduled for Nov 22, 2024

ASSESSMENT & DIAGNOSIS

Primary Diagnosis: Unstable Angina / Acute Coronary Syndrome
- High risk for myocardial infarction
- Requires urgent cardiac catheterization
- Possible need for coronary intervention (stent or CABG)

Secondary Diagnoses:
1. Uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
2. Hypertension (poorly controlled)
3. Hyperlipidemia (above target despite statin)
4. Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 2

TREATMENT PLAN

Immediate Actions:
1. Admit to cardiac care unit for monitoring
2. Start IV heparin anticoagulation
3. Continue aspirin and add clopidogrel 300mg loading dose
4. Nitroglycerin for chest pain PRN
5. NPO after midnight for catheterization

Medications Adjusted:
- Increase atorvastatin to 80mg daily (high-intensity statin)
- Add metformin extended release 2000mg daily
- Increase lisinopril to 40mg daily
- Continue metoprolol

Pending Procedures:
- Cardiac catheterization Nov 22 (confirmed)
- Possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
- If severe multi-vessel disease: CABG consultation

PATIENT EDUCATION
✓ Discussed need for cardiac catheterization
✓ Explained risks: bleeding, stroke, heart attack, death (<1%)
✓ Lifestyle modifications counseled:
  - Low sodium diet (<2000mg/day)
  - Cardiac rehabilitation program enrollment
  - Smoking cessation (patient currently smokes 1 pack/day)
  - Weight loss goal: 25 lbs over 6 months
  - Regular exercise after cardiac clearance

FOLLOW-UP
- Cardiology follow-up: 1 week post-procedure
- Primary care follow-up: 2 weeks
- Diabetes management: Endocrinology referral
- Cardiac rehabilitation: Start within 2 weeks post-discharge

SOCIAL HISTORY
- Occupation: Software engineer (sedentary job)
- Smoking: 1 pack per day x 20 years (20 pack-years)
- Alcohol: Occasional, 2-3 drinks per week
- Exercise: Minimal, <30 minutes per week
- Stress level: High (reports work-related stress)

RISK STRATIFICATION
GRACE Score: 145 (High risk - 12% mortality at 6 months)
TIMI Score: 5 (22% risk of death/MI/revascularization at 14 days)

CRITICAL REMINDER FOR ALL PROVIDERS:
⚠️ PENICILLIN ALLERGY - USE ALTERNATIVE ANTIBIOTICS
⚠️ SULFA ALLERGY - AVOID SULFONAMIDES
⚠️ LATEX ALLERGY - USE NON-LATEX GLOVES AND EQUIPMENT

PROGNOSIS
Without intervention: High risk of myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac death
With appropriate treatment: Good prognosis if revascularization successful
Long-term management: Requires strict medication compliance, lifestyle changes

PHYSICIAN NOTES
Patient demonstrates good understanding of condition. Appears motivated to 
make lifestyle changes. Family support system in place (spouse present at visit).
Discussed realistic expectations for recovery and long-term management.
